v4.3.1 - Changelog

New
---
- Disable farming fans settings when user in-game race agenda is to be used instead. This is not retroactive so users will need to turn off the farming fans checkbox themselves or toggle the User Agenda checkbox.
- Add handling for scheduled race warning popup when trying to recover energy/mood/injury.

Adjustments
---
- Bump Automation Library to version 2.3.3 to provide additional fallback logic for the drag-to-dismiss feature.
- Move scheduled race check outside of Main screen loop and consolidate fallback race event code.
- Update the `Race` button image asset to prevent false positive with dialog header text.
- Remove obsolete Unity Cup warning about farming fans from the `Settings` page.
- Only apply the user's in-game race agenda if there is no maiden race criteria active.
