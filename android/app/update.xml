v4.1.0 - Changelog

Adjustments
---
- Use the newly updated Automation Library to bundle Google ML Kit into the app. This should solve the issue on some devices where they cannot fetch Google ML Kit by themselves.
- Refactored OCR functionality to use the Library's findText() function and cleaned up when it should detect characters or digits.
- Refactored usage of printToLog() calls to use the new log level wrappers instead from the updated Automation Library.
- Rearranged the eligibility check to start the extra racing process.

Fixed
---
- Prevent dividers and empty strings from being processed in handleTrainingEvent().
