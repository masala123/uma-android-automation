/** Represents a single skill entry in a skill list.
 *
 * This class acts as a doubly linked list node, with references to both its direct
 * upgrade and downgraded versions.
 *
 * @param skillData The SkillData instance containing static skill information.
 * @param bIsObtained Whether this entry has been purchased.
 * @param bIsVirtual Whether this entry is considered a virtual entry in the skill list.
 * Virtual entries are in-place upgrades to skills that currently exist in the list.
 * Since these in-place upgrades do not appear in the list until all previous
 * versions have been purchased, we consider them to be "virtual" entries.
 * @param prev A pointer to this skill's downgrade SkillListEntry.
 * @param next A pointer to this skill's upgrade SkillListEntry.
 *
 * @property name The skill name (from skillData).
 * @property screenPrice The current price of the skill as it is shown in the game.
 * @property price The actual price of just this skill, ignoring previous version prices.
 * @property rawPrice `price` but without any discounts applied.
 * @property discount The current discount percentage / 100.
 * @property evaluationPoints The amount of rank gained upon purchasing this skill.
 * @property evaluationPointRatio The ratio of rank to `price`.
 * @property bIsAvailable Whether this skill is available for purchase.
 * @property bIsInheritedUnique Whether this skill is a unique skill inherited from a legacy uma.
 * @property bIsNegative Whether this is a negative (purple icon) skill.
 * @property bIsInPlace Whether this skill can be upgraded in-place.
 * @property runningStyle The RunningStyle associated with this skill.
 * If no RunningStyle applies, then this value will be NULL.
 * @property trackDistance The TrackDistance associated with this skill.
 * If no TrackDistance applies, then this value will be NULL.
 * @property trackSurface The TrackSurface associated with this skill.
 * If no TrackSurface applies, then this value will be NULL.
 * @property inferredRunningStyles The inferred RunningStyles associated with this skill.
 * Can be empty if none apply.
 * @property communityTier The community ranking of this skill where lower values are better.
 * @property baseCost The base price of this skill without any discounts applied from SkillData.
